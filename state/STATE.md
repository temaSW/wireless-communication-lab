# state/STATE.md

## Current Objective

Update the lab website with a patents placeholder, grant projects, and team CV
profile pages.

## Completed

- Read the existing website structure, README, renderer, and build scripts.
- Read the external harness methodology in
  `A:\PetProjects\UpdateAgentEnviroment`.
- Created root agent documentation split into instruction, architecture,
  environment, tools, state, and feedback subsystems.
- Added `tools/codex-check.ps1` as a repeatable smoke-check.
- Ran `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\codex-check.ps1`
  successfully.
- Added `tools/translate-ru-to-en.js` for RU to EN Markdown translation through
  ordinary free translation APIs: MyMemory by default and optional LibreTranslate.
- Verified translation tooling with `node --check`, `--help`, and a MyMemory
  dry-run without writing files.
- Re-ran `tools/codex-check.ps1` successfully after adding translation tooling.
- Updated the people card renderer and all theme preview styles so person cards
  use a larger `photo | information` layout while keeping people data sourced
  from Markdown.
- Ran `tools/codex-check.ps1` successfully after the people card layout update.
- Extended Markdown rendering so `#` sections, nested subsections, lists, and
  home-page action links render consistently across theme previews.
- Removed visible `undefined` fallbacks from shared renderers and converted the
  home contact link into a mail button action.
- Moved RU to EN synchronization behind the explicit `LAB_AUTO_TRANSLATE=1`
  switch so ordinary content builds do not depend on network translation.
- Added a patents page placeholder to the shared navigation and all theme
  previews.
- Replaced project placeholders with grant and research project cards sourced
  from the supplied Kryukov and Pokamestov documents.
- Added CV profile content for Yakov Kryukov and Dmitriy Pokamestov, plus CV
  links from their people cards.
- Extended the shared content builder and theme renderer for `patents` and
  `cv` pages.
- Regenerated `js/lab-content.js` with the local default `node tools/build-content.js`.
- Simplified section rendering by removing visible kicker labels from public
  page headers.
- Changed people cards so CV links are attached to the person's name instead
  of appearing as a separate contact row.
- Changed news editing to the simpler inline `content/news/<lang>.md` format,
  where each `##` section is one news item; legacy `news/items` folders remain
  parser-compatible as fallback.
- Changed CV source files to separate `content/cv/<surname>_<lang>.md` files.
- Added `content/README.md` with editor-facing instructions for non-technical
  content maintenance.
- Full `tools/codex-check.ps1` passed after translation was made opt-in.
- Simplified CV profile pages so their content renders as ordinary text
  sections instead of card-like blocks, and removed leadership wording from the
  Kryukov profile.
- Regrouped the projects page into thematic lists: RSF, Priority 2030, TUSUR
  Advanced Engineering School, UMNIK, industry contracts, and individual grants.
- Filled the patents page from the supplied `Патенты.7z` archive as grouped
  lists of inventions, utility models, and software registrations.
- Re-ran `tools/codex-check.ps1` successfully after the CV, projects, and
  patents updates.
- Changed projects and patents rendering from card grids to ordinary
  sequential grouped lists sourced from one Markdown file per language.
- Added patent PDF files under `assets/patents/` and linked all patent entries
  to their PDFs.
- Sorted project and patent entries within each group by year in the Markdown
  sources.

## In Progress

- No active website content implementation work.

## Blocked

- Automatic translation through MyMemory is blocked until the daily quota resets
  or a reachable LibreTranslate endpoint is configured.

## Known Issues

- The working tree had pre-existing modifications before this harness work.
- The generated `js/lab-content.js` may change when checks regenerate content;
  treat pre-existing generated changes separately from harness changes.
- `content/publications/en.md` is currently a copied fallback of the Russian
  publications list; replace it with edited English content when translation
  quality matters.

## Temporary Decisions

- The harness is stored in repository-level files rather than ignored `codex/`
  files so future agents can discover it reproducibly.

## Next Actions

- Use `AGENTS.md` as the entry point for future agent work.
- Keep `tools/INDEX.md` updated when reusable project tools change.
- For higher translation quality without paid APIs, configure a local or trusted
  LibreTranslate endpoint and use `--provider libre`.

## Update Policy

Update this file after meaningful project-state changes, before long pauses, when
blocked, or when handing work to another agent or human.
